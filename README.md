Eye_See_You
Is a surveillance system i made because most of the existing systems had major downfalls. eg They recored all the time instead of at certain times when a certain criteria was met ie a certain object comes into view or motion is detected.
This system reduces the amount of useless footage that is recorded by a significant margins if the proper setting are used.

ISTRUCTIONS
Click the system.pyw script to run it.
You can also use the login.pyw to run it after you have added an account in the accounts contol tab.
Use the 'q' key to kill feeds ,killing feeds does not stop the system it continues in the background.

Requirements
Windows xp and higher(Theoratically speaking xp should work too ,i only tested with windows 8.1).
Python 3.x.
OpenCV 3.x.
PyQt4.

Important!!
I used the system module for the deleting and moving of files in the czip class ,so if you want to port this to other platforms you need kto change those commands since their are ms-dos commands.
